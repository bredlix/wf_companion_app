### 1b. Download zip and open with Android Studio locally

On the repository page click `Code > Download ZIP`. Extract content to the preferred folder. Open Android Studio and select `Open an existing Android Studio project`. Navigate to the directory where you extracted the project and open it.

### 2. Update the Gradle build file

Open the `build.gradle.kts` file in the `app` directory.

In the Project pane, go to the `Options (3 dots) > Tree appearance > Compact Middle Packages` and uncheck/de-select it. Your package directory will now be broken up into individual directories (`com > android > wf_companion_app >...`).
Individually select each directory(`android`, `wf_companion_app`) and:

- Right-click it
- Select `Refactor`
- Click on `Rename`
- In the Pop-up dialog, click on `All Directories`
- Enter the new name and hit `Refactor`
- Allow a minute to let Android Studio update all changes.

Eventually you should have `com.your_comany.your_app_name` and the corresponding folder structure `main > java > com > your_comany > your_app_name`.

### 4. Update AndroidManifest.xml

Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Find the `<activity>` tag and change the `android:name` attribute to `com.your_comany.your_app_name.MainActivity`.

### 5. Change app icon

Right-click the res folder and go to `New > Image Asset`. On the `Foreground Layer` tab, select the `Asset Type` to `Image` and browse to the new icon you want.
On the `Background Layer` tab, select the `Asset Type` to `Color` and pick a color of your choice. Click `Next > Finish` and the icon should be changed.

### 6. Change watchface image

Go to `res > drawable` to find the `wf_img.png`. You can replace an existing image by right-clicking it and selecting `Reveal in Finder` (or `Show in Explorer` for Windows), then replace the file there with your new image (it should have the same name and format).
If you want to add a new image, simply copy and paste your image file into the `res/drawable` directory. You can then use this image in your project by referencing it as `@drawable/your_image_name`.

### 7. Change app display name

Go to `res > values` to find `strings.xml`. Change `name="app_name"` entry to your desired app name.

Go to `res > values` to find `strings.xml`. Change `name="policy_url"` entry to your Privacy Policy URL.

### 10. Sync the project with gradle

### 11. Test the build

Run your project on the connected or emulated device to see the changes take effect.
